Power BI analysis of Maven Market csv files. This repo is a follow up to my *AdventureWorks* repo, where I went through a lesson on Power BI dashboards. In this portion, I was given several datasets and some written instruction on what was needed to complete the report. I found that I had no real issue with connectiong & shaping the data, creating the data model, or building out reports. What I found once running this on my own was that I was not proficient in DAX. I struggled through this one, utilizing some hints and doing the research, but I will be looking further into the DAX formulas for future endeavors.

My final report (screenshot):
